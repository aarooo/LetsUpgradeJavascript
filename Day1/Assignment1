        var a = "Hello";
    }
    console.log(a);
}
m();
Output:- Hello


let is used to create locacl variable for example in the code given below we have declared variable inside if body and we can not access the variable outside the if body.
function m(){
    if(true){
        let a = "Hello";
    }
    console.log(a);
}
m();
Output:- Error


const is used to make the value of variable permanent.Which means we can not change the value of const variable once a variable is defined
function m(){
    const a = "hello";
    console.log(a);
    a = "hi";
    console.log(a);
    
}

 	Example :- 
    i)let n = 123;
    ii) alert( "not a number" / 2 );     //NAN  value


 4-bigint  :- It  is for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
 	Example-
 	i)// the "n" at the end means it's a BigInt
const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n;

 5-null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.

6-undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
